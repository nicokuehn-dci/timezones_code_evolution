# Timezones Code Evolution

This repository contains three Python scripts that demonstrate the evolution of a program designed to handle timezones. Each script builds upon the previous one, adding new features and improving functionality. Below is an overview of the scripts and instructions on how to use them.

## 1. Initial Version
The first script provides basic functionality for working with timezones. It allows users to convert a given time from one timezone to another using a predefined list of timezones.

### Features:
- Basic timezone conversion.
- Limited to a predefined set of timezones.

### Usage:
Run the script and follow the prompts to input the time, source timezone, and target timezone.

```bash
python script1.py
```

---

## 2. Intermediate Version
The second script improves upon the initial version by introducing support for dynamic timezone fetching and better error handling.

### Features:
- Fetches an updated list of timezones dynamically.
- Improved error handling for invalid inputs.

### Usage:
Run the script as before, but now enjoy a more robust experience with dynamic timezone support.

```bash
python script2.py
```

## 3. Final Version
The final script represents the most advanced version, adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

### Features:
- Fully functional GUI for timezone conversion.
- Retains all features from the previous versions.
- User-friendly interface for selecting timezones and inputting data.

### Usage:
Run the script to launch the GUI and interact with the application.

```bash
python script3.py
```

## Evolution Summary
1. **Initial Version**: Basic functionality for timezone conversion.
2. **Intermediate Version**: Enhanced with dynamic timezone fetching and error handling.
3. **Final Version**: Introduced a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.

Each script demonstrates a step in the evolution of the program, showcasing how features and usability were incrementally improved. Feel free to explore the scripts to understand the progression and use the final version for the best experience.
